# Week 2 Portfolio

In this week, we learnt making slides by Xaringan in Rstudio and writing learning diary by Quarto as well. I made a Xaringan slides for summarizing Landsat 8 OLI sensor, and collected several applications based on OLI imagery. Following url is my Xaringan slides link. I think that after this exercise I will be able to master the basic usage of Xaringan to create slideshows and be able to use Xaringan proficiently.
